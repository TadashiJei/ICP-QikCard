# Challenges Faced During WCHL 2025 Development

## Overview

This document outlines the significant technical, design, and implementation challenges encountered during the development of QikCard Platform for WCHL 2025, along with our problem-solving approaches and lessons learned.

## Technical Challenges

### 1. ICP Canister Inter-Communication Complexity

**Challenge**: Implementing seamless communication between 6 different canisters while maintaining data consistency and handling potential failures.

**Problem Details**:
- Cross-canister calls can fail due to network issues or canister unavailability
- Managing transaction state across multiple canisters
- Ensuring atomic operations across distributed components
- Handling cycles management for inter-canister calls

**Solution Approach**:
```rust
// Implemented retry mechanism with exponential backoff
async fn reliable_canister_call<T>(
    canister_id: Principal,
    method: &str,
    args: Vec<u8>,
    max_retries: u32
) -> Result<T, String> {
    let mut attempt = 0;
    
    while attempt < max_retries {
        match ic_cdk::call(canister_id, method, args.clone()).await {
            Ok(result) => return Ok(result),
            Err(e) => {
                if attempt == max_retries - 1 {
                    return Err(format!("Final attempt failed: {:?}", e));
                }
                
                // Exponential backoff
                let delay = Duration::from_millis(100 * 2_u64.pow(attempt));
                ic_cdk_timers::set_timer(delay, || {});
                attempt += 1;
            }
        }
    }
    
    Err("Max retries exceeded".to_string())
}
```

**Lessons Learned**:
- Always implement retry mechanisms for critical inter-canister calls
- Use compensation patterns for distributed transactions
- Monitor canister cycles proactively to prevent call failures

### 2. NFC Hardware Integration with Web3

**Challenge**: Bridging the gap between physical NFC hardware and blockchain operations while maintaining security and user experience.

**Problem Details**:
- NFC data payload limitations (924 bytes for NTAG216)
- Secure transmission of cryptographic signatures
- Real-time synchronization between hardware events and blockchain state
- Cross-platform NFC support (iOS, Android, desktop limitations)

**Solution Approach**:
```cpp
// Implemented efficient data encoding for NFC payload
struct CompactNFCPayload {
    uint16_t version;           // 2 bytes
    uint64_t timestamp;         // 8 bytes  
    uint8_t device_id[16];      // 16 bytes (truncated hash)
    uint8_t user_principal[29]; // 29 bytes (ICP principal)
    uint8_t signature[64];      // 64 bytes (ECDSA signature)
    uint8_t event_data[32];     // 32 bytes (event context)
    // Total: 151 bytes (well under 924 byte limit)
};
```

**Lessons Learned**:
- Optimize data structures for hardware constraints
- Implement progressive enhancement for different NFC capabilities
- Use secure elements for cryptographic operations on resource-constrained devices

### 3. Real-time Analytics at Scale

**Challenge**: Processing thousands of simultaneous NFC interactions during large events while maintaining sub-second response times.

**Problem Details**:
- High-frequency data ingestion from multiple QikPoint scanners
- Real-time dashboard updates for event organizers
- Memory limitations in ICP canisters for large datasets
- Balancing real-time processing with cost optimization

**Solution Approach**:
```rust
// Implemented batched processing with timer-based aggregation
#[heartbeat]
async fn process_analytics_batch() {
    let pending_interactions = get_pending_interactions();
    
    if pending_interactions.len() >= BATCH_SIZE || 
       time_since_last_batch() > MAX_BATCH_DELAY {
        
        let aggregated_data = aggregate_interactions(pending_interactions);
        update_analytics_state(aggregated_data);
        broadcast_updates_to_subscribers().await;
        clear_pending_interactions();
    }
}
```

**Lessons Learned**:
- Batch processing significantly reduces canister update calls
- Use stable memory for large datasets to survive canister upgrades

- User experience for crypto novices

**Solution Approach**:
```rust
// Implemented hierarchical deterministic wallet structure
async fn derive_user_key(
    user_principal: Principal,
    derivation_purpose: DerivationPurpose
) -> Result<Vec<u8>, String> {
    let base_path = vec![b"qikcard".to_vec()];
    let user_path = user_principal.as_slice().to_vec();
    let purpose_path = match derivation_purpose {
        DerivationPurpose::Bitcoin => vec![0u8],
        DerivationPurpose::Ethereum => vec![1u8],
        DerivationPurpose::ICP => vec![2u8],
    };
    
    let full_path = [base_path, vec![user_path], vec![purpose_path]].concat();
    
    let key_request = EcdsaPublicKeyArgument {
        canister_id: None,
        derivation_path: full_path,
        key_id: EcdsaKeyId {
            curve: EcdsaCurve::Secp256k1,
            name: "key_1".to_string(),
        },
    };
    
    match ecdsa_public_key(key_request).await {
        Ok((key,)) => Ok(key.public_key),
        Err(e) => Err(format!("Key derivation failed: {:?}", e)),
    }
}
